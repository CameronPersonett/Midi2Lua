# Midi2Lua

The original idea behind this was to bring rock music (or any notated music for that matter) to Minecraft. 

This program is able to take MIDI files (like the ones I had generated from Guitar Pro) and convert them to Lua scripts
to be run on a ComputerCraft (or CC: Tweaked) computer connected to a speaker to play any song you have a MIDI file for.
